# You should try to determine the right calibration factor for your house,
# not assume the default is reasonable. Basically, a factor of 2.0 means that
# there is half the amount of temperature differential at the “coldest” part
# of the house (as the docs suggest, typically a window) than at the thermostat.
# So, given your numbers – 6 outside, 20 inside – a factor of 2 would assume
# the window is 13 and base its condensation estimate on that temperature.
