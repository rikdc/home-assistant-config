# Emby
#
# The purpose of this package is to allow a random TV show to start
# after an NFC tag is scanned.
# 
# This package has largely been inspired by:
# - https://community.home-assistant.io/t/thought-id-share-my-nfc-tag-emby-media-player-setup/282127
# - How to get a dynamic input_select: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/fill-input-select/63865/43
# - 
#
# - The Room detemines which Emby instance is enabled.
# - A list of shows to randomly tag
# - API access to Emby, needs to be added to secrets.
# - Check if the Roku is on, and Emby App is activated.
